# This sample build has exactly one step: build a new container image using this
# repository as source. Here we use the 'docker' image to build the image and
# tag it with the name of the image.
steps:
# Build the container image
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  #args: [dotnet test]
  args: ['build', '-f', 'cbunittest/Dockerfile', '--tag=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/cbtest:$SHORT_SHA', '--tag=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/cbtest:latest', '.']

# Push the container image to Container Registry
#- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
#  args: ['push', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/cbtest:$SHORT_SHA'] 
#- name: 'mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.0'
#  args: ['push','gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/cbtest:latest'] 

## Deploy container image to Cloud Run
#- name: 'gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk'
#  entrypoint: gcloud
#  args: ['run', 'deploy', 'SERVICE-NAME', '--image', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/helloworld-webapp:latest', '--region', '{$_REGION}']

# Run Test Case
# - name: 'node'
#   args: ['npm', 'install']
# - name: 'node'
#   args: ['npm', 'run', 'test']
#   env:
#     - 'Url=$_SERVICE_URL'

# By default, all built docker images will be lost once the build is complete.
# Rather than writing a build step to push this image, you can simply list the
# image below and it will automatically be uploaded to Google Cloud Container
# Registry.
#images:
#- 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/cbtest:$SHORT_SHA'
#- 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/cbtest:latest' 
# You can organize your builds with tags
tags: ['cbtest']

# You can configure more options than the ones listed here. Visit
# https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/build-config to see the full list of
# available options
